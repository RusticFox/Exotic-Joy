This mod will make tweaks to the base game you never knew you needed until now..

Adds the following:

✯ Horseshoe pins can now be used by all tech tiers
✯ Horseshoe pins now show you the use area (unless cutoff) (V1.0 Exclusive)(Added to base game in V1.1)
✯ Horseshoe pins are now rotatable (V1.0 Exclusive)(Added to base game in V1.1)
✯ Game of UR can now be used by all tech tiers

✯ Hoopstone now show you the use area (unless cutoff) (V1.0 Exclusive) (Added to base game in V1.1)
✯ Hoopstone are now rotatable (V1.0 Exclusive)(Added to base game in V1.1)
✯ Chess Tables can now be used by all tech tiers
✯ Megascreen Televisions can now be constructed
✯ Telescopes can now be constructed

Research:
- Telescope 1000 Requires MicroelectronicsBasics
- Megascreen 2000 Requires FlatscreenTelevision and MicroelectronicsBasics
- All research can be found under Rustic's Mods which is universal for my mods that require research (unless you use a mod tab editor then it will be whereever generated)

Compatibility - Works with both game versions 1.0 and version 1.1

Mod Compatibility - Should be compatable with everything. Uses xpath patching and overwrites no core files.

Older versions - https://github.com/RusticFox/Exotic-Joy

Mod Version: 2.0.1
